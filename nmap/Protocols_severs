This room covered various protocols, their usage, and how they work under the hood. Many other standard protocols are of interest to attackers. For instance, Server Message Block (SMB) provides shared access to files and printers between networks, and it can be an exciting target. However, this room intends only to give you a good knowledge of a few common protocols and how they work under the hood. One room or even a complete module canâ€™t cover all the network protocols.

It is good to remember the default port number for common protocols. Below is a summary of the protocols we covered, sorted in alphabetical order, along with their default port numbers.
