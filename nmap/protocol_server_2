This room covered various protocols, their usage, and how they work under the hood. Three common attacks are:

Sniffing Attack
MITM Attack
Password Attack
For each of the above, we focused both on the attack details and the mitigation steps.

Many other attacks can be conducted against specific servers and protocols. We will provide a list of some related modules.

Vulnerability Research: This module provides more information about vulnerabilities and exploits.
Metasploit: This module trains you on how to use Metasploit to exploit target systems.
Burp Suite: This module teaches you how to use Burp Suite to intercept HTTP traffic and launch attacks related to the web.
It is good to remember the default port number for common protocols. For convenience, the services we covered are listed in the following table sorted by alphabetical order.

Protocol	TCP Port	Application(s)	Data Security
FTP	21	File Transfer	Cleartext
FTPS	990	File Transfer	Encrypted
HTTP	80	Worldwide Web	Cleartext
HTTPS	443	Worldwide Web	Encrypted
IMAP	143	Email (MDA)	Cleartext
IMAPS	993	Email (MDA)	Encrypted
POP3	110	Email (MDA)	Cleartext
POP3S	995	Email (MDA)	Encrypted
SFTP	22	File Transfer	Encrypted
SSH	22	Remote Access and File Transfer	Encrypted
SMTP	25	Email (MTA)	Cleartext
SMTPS	465	Email (MTA)	Encrypted
Telnet	23	Remote Access	Cleartext
Hydra remains a very efficient tool that you can launch from the terminal to try the different passwords. We summarize its main options in the following table.

Option	Explanation
-l username	Provide the login name
-P WordList.txt	Specify the password list to use
server service	Set the server address and service to attack
-s PORT	Use in case of non-default service port number
-V or -vV	Show the username and password combinations being tried
-d	Display debugging output if the verbose output is not helping
